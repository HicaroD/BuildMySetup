# BuildMySetup
:wrench: A simple Python script to set up my own development environment quickly, so I don't need to do it manually.

## Progress 

- [x] Update system (`sudo pacman -Syu` for updating the system. See [Partial upgrades are unsupported](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported))
- [x] Install all necessary packages / apps (Git, Zsh + [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install), [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Go](https://go.dev/dl/))
- [ ] Configure Git (Username, e-mail, core editor and more)
- [ ] Configure Neovim ([`dotfiles-neovim`](https://github.com/HicaroD/dotfiles-neovim) to `~/.config/nvim`)
- [ ] Install all Neovim plugins ([`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug))
- [ ] Download my personal notes (It's on a private repository) and paste into `~/Documents/` directory
